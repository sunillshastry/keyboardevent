## by Sunil Shastry.

---

_KeyboardEvent is a simple and easy-to-use web application that helps you ease your JavaScript complications by helping you access the Javascript keyboard event's DOM attribute values such as code, key & keyCode and more._

---

### How to use?

- Access the website by visiting [KeyboardEvent](https://keyboardevent.netlify.app/ "KeyboardEvent").

- Please make sure you are using the website on a Mac or PC. The website cannot be utilized fully on a mobile device or any device without a physical or virtual keyboard.

- While you're on the website, enter any key you wish from the keyboard, the web application does its task and fetches the Browser API' keyboard event attributes.

- You will be provided with the keyboard event's `charCode`, `code`, `key`, `keyCode`, `ctrlKey`, `shiftKey` and `altKey`.

- To copy the content from a block, simply click on it and the value will be automatically copied to your clipboard.

> **Please access the website on a PC/Mac**. Although fully responsive in nature, the website does not fully function without a keyboard.
